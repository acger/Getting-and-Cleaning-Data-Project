# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

## Description
The script for creating a tidy data set from raw data (*run_analysis.R*). The script downloads the raw data, unzips it, performs some processing and saves the result to a file.

## Running the script
The script uses its current directory as the working directory. As long as you are happy with this default option, you don't need to make any modifications to the script.

## Transformation
The detailed description of the transformations performed by the script can be found in the codebook (codebook.md).
